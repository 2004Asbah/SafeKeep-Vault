# Screenshots Placeholder

To complete your showcase README, add screenshots here:

## Required Screenshots

1. **login.png** - Login screen showing Admin/Staff portals
2. **dashboard.png** - Admin dashboard with metrics
3. **upload.png** - File upload with compression progress
4. **vault.png** - Vault explorer with file list
5. **audit.png** - Audit logs page

## How to Capture

1. Run the application: `docker-compose up`
2. Open browser: `http://localhost:8501`
3. Take screenshots of each page
4. Save them in this directory with the names above

## Tips

- Use full browser window (not just content)
- Show real data (upload test files first)
- Use consistent browser size (1920x1080 recommended)
- Crop to remove browser chrome if desired

## Alternative

If you don't want to add screenshots yet, you can:
1. Remove the screenshots section from README.md
2. Or replace with text descriptions
3. Or use placeholder images from https://placeholder.com
